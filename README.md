## **WebScrapping using Python:**
Scrapping Instagram account

Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning. Here, I have shown a procedure to extract data from instagram profile such as name of the account holder, number of followers, following and total number of post person has published. In the end, extracted data saved into the CSV file.
