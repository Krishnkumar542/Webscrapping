## **WebScrapping using Python:**
Scrapping Instagram account

Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning. Here, I have shown a procedure to <a href="https://github.com/Krishnkumar542/Webscrapping_Instagram/blob/main/sushant_singh_rajput_insta_scrapping.ipynb">extract data from instagram profile</a> such as name of the account holder, number of followers, following and total number of post person has published. In the end, extracted data saved into the <a href="https://github.com/Krishnkumar542/Webscrapping_Instagram/blob/main/sushant_singh_rajput_insta_Scrap.csv">CSV file</a>.
